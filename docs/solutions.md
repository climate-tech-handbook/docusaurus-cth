# Climate Solutions

### Good news!

We already have the science and technology needed to win this critical decade.

We just need to scale up in the next 5-10 years

:::info What is Project Drawdown?
The Handbook is based off of the [Project Drawdown](drawdown.org) solutions framework.

Below is a list of all 93 Drawdown Solutions organized by sector.

Each solution comes with a calculated number of greenhouse emissions that need to be reduced each year to stay below 2C average temperature.
