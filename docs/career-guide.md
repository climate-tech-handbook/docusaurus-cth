You are committed to impactful climate work - congrats! ðŸŽ¶

![Organice farm soil](../static/img/organic-farming_resize.jpg)
## There are four steps:

1. Choose your [employer type](#choose-your-employer-type) and look at [job boards](#job-boards)
2. Evaluate your [skills and experience](#evaluate-your-skills-and-experience)
3. Build your [community and network](build-your-community-and-network)
4. Pick your [climate solution](solutions) and [information diet](resources)

## Choose your employer type
:::note You have a choice
1. Try to make your "regular job" more climate positive
2. Leave your "regular job" and work for a dedicated climate organization
<!--drawdown guide for climate at work-->
:::
_Note: most climate tech companies are early stage startups. <br/>
We will continue to delve deeper into this dynamic. <br/>There are other options such as government jobs._

## Job boards

The two most popular:
- [ClimateBase](https://climatebase.org)
- [Climate Tech List](https://climatetechlist.com)
- ...there are dozens and dozens more on [Nicole Kelner's spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QzarGBkRUvTSx8qu92O0d3zJ6XkblfyyMONSPUsoLgs/edit#gid=0).

## Evaluate your skills and experience

:::note Tech skills and experience
* Do you already have "regular tech" experience - and just need climate knowledge?
* Or...do you need a better tech portfolio + climate knowledge?
:::

If you'd like a stronger portfolio for tech skills or climate knowledge:
