**The Big Question:**

To what degree should nature-based solutions be a part of carbon markets?

Additionally:

 - Should we as an industry be trying to fund things like regenerative agriculture and forestry with carbon credits?

 - Or should we fund those things via government programs or philanthropy? 

 - If its a mixture of both, where is the line?
